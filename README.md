## Background
MuDiBot started as a little bot for my Discord server and began to grow with time.

This bot's goal is to offer many functionalities for both server moderation and administration, but also fun features like custom commands and practical ones like a video player.

Special thanks to [mozico555](https://github.com/mozico555) and Neyo for suggestions, ideas and bug reports.

## Install
**This bot require Node.js 12.0.0 or newer. You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/**

Start by running this command in your local bot directory
```
npm install
```

Then, fill `config.js`. More information will be found inside.

**You will also need to create a bot user and invite it to your guild! A guide is on the way.**

## Usage
Start the bot by running `run.sh` or `run.bat`.

You can then write `$help` (by default) to display all the available commands.
